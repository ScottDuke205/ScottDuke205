Hello, I'm Scott. I'm a java developer. I've worked in various fields including medical software, transportation and banking. I've used various languages and 
databases, some of which no longer exist. The last few companies I worked for I have focused primarily on java focusing on Oracle IDM using JSP and Java 7. 
Also, Thymeleaf and Spring using Java 8. I've had a lot of years being a support/maintenance developer as well as developing new applications. I also spent 
a year working with Xamarin and enjoyed the experience it gave in mobile development.

I'm currently reviewing Spring and Java 8 to fill the gaps I have not worked with directly and improve my skills as a developer.
